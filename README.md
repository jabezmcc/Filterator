# Filterator
A program to simulate the action of a digital electronic filter on a signal. Input signal is specified by size in volts, frequency, and waveform (sine, square or triangle).  Size can be given as amplitude, rms, or peak to peak. Filter is specified by the type (Butterworth or Bessel), critical frequency, and number of poles.  The Bode plot of the filter is shown in the lower left, and the affect on the signal is shown in the lower right.  Amplitude, rms and peak-to-peak outputs are calculated numerically and displayed above the output graph.
